Data Science Corsera
====================

This is my **github** account, opened to do my project work as part of the *Coursera* **Data Science** course.

My teachers are Jeff Leek, Roger Peng and Brian Caffo.

As part of my first project I followed Jeff's [GitHub datasharing project](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing).

My version is accessible under [this link](https://github.com/acoveny/datasharing), but nothing has been added as yet.
